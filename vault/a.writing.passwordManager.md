## Password Manager for ~~"the future"~~ 2023

I know only a single password, and that's for my password manager, everything else is randomly generated

Currently, we use Bitwarden. The auto-type functionality in the desktop app is still not implemented. 
So I am looking for a new solution.

### My expectancies

- has a family feature (5 pax)
- uses 2fa for login to the system
- can have 2fa for each login
- auto-type
  - in broser
  - on mobile
  - on desktop
  - is configurable per login


### Possible candidates

- [[p.passBolt]]
- Padloc
- 1Password
- LastPass (was hacked)
- Dashlane
